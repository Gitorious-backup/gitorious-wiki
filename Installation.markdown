The absolutely easiest way to get a Gitorious server up and running is to use the standard installer or prebuilt appliance which can be found at [Install Gitorious](http://getgitorious.com/install-gitorious) page at the [getgitorious.com](http://getgitorious.com) website.

Active development happens on the git branch ":master", and we will try to keep it stable. However, the tags will receive more testing, and in general should be more reliable as a mechanism to upgrade local installs. git master should be considered "Gitorious beta" (generally stable, may have occasional issues, incomplete features a.s.o), while tags provide stable releases.
