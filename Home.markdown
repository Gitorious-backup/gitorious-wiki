# Gitorious

**Gitorious is a free, libre, open source application** originally developed for hosting projects in Git repositories.

It can be used on the official public instance, or as a self-hosted service. Both offer merge requests and per-project issue tracking. The self-hosted service can handle both public and private repositories.
