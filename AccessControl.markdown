By default, all projects and repositories in Gitorious are public. But if you have your own Gitorious installation, you may make both projects and repositories private.


## Private projects
When a repository is made private, nobody can see or access the project except the _collaborators_.
A collaborator can a team or a single user.

Each collaborator can see and view the project, as well as all public (non-private) repositories in that project. As soon as a repository in that project is made private, the collaborator cannot see the repository anymore, except he is given at least read access to the repository.
